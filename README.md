Welcome to **SMIP**, a game where you can literally invest in your favorite TikTok videos.

This is a personal project made in NextJS, React, and a Python Backend.

Feel free to make a pull request to add to this project.


***How To Use***
1. Create an account on SMIP and explore the app
2. Find a TikTok video that you think will go up significantly in likes 
3. Hit share, copy the video link, and paste it into SMIP under the Trades tab.
4. Specify the amount you would like to buy and place your investment
5. Return to the investment after some time to check the change in likes and your return
6. Sell it to liquidate your money and make more investments
7. Try to make it to the top of the leaderboards!

  - You can and will lose money on bad investments (videos that don't go up enough in likes)
  - I suggest diversifying, this is inspired by stock simulators so treating it like the stock market is good advice
  - Everyone starts with 100k, but if you lose it all there is no way to earn more. Your account will be unusable.
  - Returns are generated with a logarithmic equation that takes into account initial likes and followers. Videos that already have many likes and videos posted by popular accounts are likely to have lower returns.
